This game is inspired off of mobile games like Doodle Jump where you are continuously moving upwards, progressing by 
stepping on steps while avoiding obstacles. It is coded in a Java based programming language called Processing and is
implemented with object oriented programming.

In more specific detail, this game has two levels, with the first level being directly inspired by Doodle Jump and the second
level being a race through a maze against a programmed opponent. The way the character moves upwards is directly related to 
the amplitude of the soundwaves picked up by the computer's microphone. This character moves left by pressing the "a" key
and moves "right" by pressing the "d" key. During the game, if the character touches any other object other than the steps,
the game will give the user the option to start the game over. The player wins once the character touches the top of the
game screen. Once this happens the player is directed to the second level where the objective is still to reach the top of
the game screen. However, instead, this level consists of large rectangles from the left and right side of the game screen. 
As the player gets closer to the top of the screen, the gap between these rectangles gets smaller.
